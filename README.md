# Video Crawler for Haokan website

A distributed video downloader.
Use scrapy framework & pika/redis database to download & store video data.
Note: this repository is only for reference of my previous work experience & will not be maintained; this crawler is mal-functioned right now due to change in target web structure. No future recovery possible.
